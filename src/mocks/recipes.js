    name: 'French Omelette',
    tags: ['Egg'],
    country: 'French',
    ingredients: ['Eggs', 'Butter', 'Parmesan', 'Tarragon', 'Parsley', 'Chives', 'Gruyère'],
    instructions: [
      'Get everything ready. Warm a 20cm (measured across the top) non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork so they break up and mix, but not as completely as you would for scrambled egg. With the heat on medium-hot, drop one knob of butter into the pan. It should bubble and sizzle, but not brown. Season the eggs with the Parmesan and a little salt and pepper, and pour into the pan.',
      'Let the eggs bubble slightly for a couple of seconds, then take a wooden fork or spatula and gently draw the mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds in the centre. Leave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine uncooked egg with cooked. Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster, stopping while there’s some barely cooked egg left. With the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture. It should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top. A quick burst of heat will brown the underside.',
      'Grip the handle underneath. Tilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge. Fold the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto a plate – or fold it in half, if that’s easier. For a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers. Rub the other knob of butter over to glaze. Serve immediately.',

      'Place a heaped tbsp of the filling in the middle of the round, then fold the pastry over to make a half-moon shape. Fold in the edges, twisting them to seal, and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling to make 8 briks in all.',
      'Lightly brush the briks with the remaining oil. Bake for 12–15 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and golden brown.',
      'Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes and cucumber in a bowl and sprinkle with the lemon juice and seasoning to taste. Serve the briks hot with this salad and the chutney.',

    instructions: [
      'As the cooking time varies depending on the quality and age of the beans, it is good to cook them in advance and to reheat them when you are ready to serve.Cook the drained beans in a fresh portion of unsalted water in a large saucepan with the lid on until tender, adding water to keep them covered, and salt when the beans have softened.They take 2–2 1 / 2 hours of gentle simmering.When the beans are soft, let the liquid reduce.It is usual to take out a ladle or two of the beans and to mash them with some of the cooking liquid, then stir this back into the beans.This is to thicken the sauce.',
      'Serve the beans in soup bowls sprinkled with chopped parsley and accompanied by Arab bread.',
      'Pass round the dressing ingredients for everyone to help themselves: a bottle of extra- virgin olive oil, the quartered lemons, salt and pepper, a little saucer with the crushed garlic, one with chili - pepper flakes, and one with ground cumin.',

      'In Syria and Lebanon, they eat ful medames with yogurt or feta cheese, olives, and small cucumbers.',
      'Variations',
      'A traditional way of thickening the sauce is to throw a handful of red lentils(1 / 4 cup) into the water at the start of the cooking.',
      'In Iraq, large brown beans are used instead of the small Egyptian ones, in a dish called badkila, which is also sold for breakfast in the street.',
